                Concern is growing over the spread of Wuhan Coronavirus, which has killed many people in China as well as other countries. There are now almost 90,000 cases worldwide in about 70 countries, although the vast majority - just under 90% - remain in China, and most of those are in Hubei province, where the virus originated late last year. The outbreak began at a live animal market in Wuhan. Majority of the cases are in the central China city itself, which has now effectively been placed in quarantine.

                Of the nearly 28,800 cases reported outside China, mostly are in four countries - Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan. Italy raised its death toll by almost 30 on Monday going up to a total of 463, with thousands of confirmed cases in all 20 regions. Iran reported another 43 deaths, taking the total there to 237. In the UK, where there are above 300 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the virus was "likely to become more significant in the days and weeks ahead". Portugal, Iceland, Jordan, Tunisia, Armenia, Latvia, Senegal, Andorra and many more reported their confirmed cases in the last few days.

                It is a ‚Äúnovel coronavirus‚Äù. The term ‚Äúnovel‚Äù simply means that the strain is newly identified. Typically a coronavirus causes a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache, fever but can also cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, notably pneumonia, especially among very young or old people and those with weakened immune systems or existing cardiopulmonary disease. This appears to have been the primary cause of death for the victims of the Wuhan Coronavirus, which is also known as Covid-19.
                 ‚ÄúCoronaviruses are mainly transmitted by large respiratory droplets and direct or indirect contact with infected secretions.‚Äù

                Coronavirus is a respiratory disease which seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. After a week, it leads to shortness of breath and some patients require hospital treatment. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. They are similar to those for much more common viruses, such as colds and flu.
